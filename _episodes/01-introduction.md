teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can we simulate the vibrational motion of molecules subject to realistic intramolecular forces?"
objectives:
- "We can solve Newton's equations of motion for relative motion of atoms subject to intramolecular forces."
keypoints:
- "We can use quantum chemistry to obtain a potential energy surface, from which realistic intramolecular forces 
can be derived.  We can then perform molecular dynamics simulations to solve Newton's equation of motion for the relative motion of atoms subject to realistic intramolecular forces."
