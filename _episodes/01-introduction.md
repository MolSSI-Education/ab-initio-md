Molecular Dynamics simulations provide a powerful tool for studying the motion of atomic, molecular, and nanoscale systems 
(including biomolecular systems).  In molecular dynamics simulation, the motion of the atoms are treated with classical mechanics; this means that the positions and velocities/momenta of the atoms are precisely specified throughout the simulation, and these quantities are updated using Newton's laws of motion (or equivalent formulations).  

The key idea is that given these (describe trajectories)

maybe here have a statement of these laws in words, perhaps with a link to some document where the equations are typeset

Forces come from _ab_ _initio_ potential energy surface

Potential energy surface is the ground-state electronic energy of a molecule at different geometries
